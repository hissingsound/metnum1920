## Usage

Interface guides should suffice. But here are some sample inputs as a guide:

Input 1:
We'll use this system of equations: http://courses.wccnet.edu/~palay/math181/se_4x4s.htm
```
> 2
Input jumlah variabel: 4
Koefisien-koefisien baris ke-1: 2 5 -9 3
Koefisien-koefisien baris ke-2: 5 6 -4 2
Koefisien-koefisien baris ke-3: 3 -4 2 7
Koefisien-koefisien baris ke-4: 11 7 4 -8
Input solusi-solusi persamaan: 151 103 16 -32
> 2
```

End output 1:
```
Answer: 3.000   5.000   -11.000 7.000
```

## Notes

Keep in mind that this C++ implementation has a precision 
limitation. External library is not used to maintain portability.

Documentation is provided in English, while the main interface is provided in Indonesian.

## Contributing

Pull requests are accepted. Here are some things you can do:

1. More documentation.
2. Handling table printing in a more modular way.
3. Add some test cases.
4. Translating main interface to English (English port).
It is more prefered to contribute in English so others can understand your contribution more clearly.
